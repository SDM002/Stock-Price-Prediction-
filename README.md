# Stock-Price-Prediction-
A stock, or equity, signifies ownership in a corporation, providing the shareholder with a proportional
claim to the companyâ€™s assets and profits based on the amount of stock they possess. Shares are the
individual units of stock. Typically, the term "stock" denotes ownership in any company. Stock prices
vary daily due to market forces, primarily supply and demand. When demand for a stock rise, with
more buyers than sellers, the price increases. Conversely, if there are more sellers than buyers,
creating an excess supply, the price falls. While the basic concept of supply and demand is
straightforward, the reasons behind stock price changes are complex and uncertain. Some argue that
predicting stock price movements is impossible, while others believe that analyzing charts and past
price trends can provide insights on when to buy or sell. The only certainty is that stock prices are
highly volatile and can change very quickly.
